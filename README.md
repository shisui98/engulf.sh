# engulf.sh 
# =========

### A simple script to "swallow" the terminal while launching zathura. What's so special?
### It can use fzf too! No more hunting for the write file inside zathura!
### Disclaimer: It doesn't work with any file manager (ranger/sfm/thunar), only the terminal, fzf solves the file browsing/selecting issue generally.
